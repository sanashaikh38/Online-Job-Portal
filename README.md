3 Problem Statement: Smart Resume Collection and Filtering System

Theme : Mobile/WebApp

Description : Create an AI-powered platform that streamlines the process of
collecting resumes from job applicants and automatically filters them based on
their relevance to specific job descriptions.

Expected Features:
1. Resume Collection: Allow job applicants to submit their resumes through
the platform either by uploading a file or filling out a form. Collect relevant
information such as work experience, education, skills, and certifications.
2. Job Description Analysis: Utilize natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to analyze job descriptions and extract key requirements,
qualifications, and skills needed for each job opening.
3. Resume Parsing: Implement resume parsing algorithms to extract
information from resumes and convert them into structured data that can
be analyzed and compared against job descriptions.
4. Matching Algorithm: Develop a machine learning-based matching
algorithm that compares resumes against job descriptions and assigns a
relevance score based on the degree of alignment between the two.
5. Filtering and Ranking: Automatically filter resumes based on their
relevance scores and rank them in descending order of suitability for the
job. Present the top-ranked resumes to recruiters or hiring managers for
further review.
6. Job Description Matching: Analyze job descriptions to identify key
requirements, skills, and qualifications needed for each job opening. Use
machine learning algorithms to match job seekers' profiles with relevant
job descriptions.

Technologies to Use:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilize NLP libraries and frameworks
(e.g., spaCy, Word2Vec) to analyze resumes and job descriptions, extract
relevant information, and identify semantic similarities between text
documents.
2. Machine Learning: Train machine learning models using supervised
learning techniques to build the recommendation and matching
algorithms, leveraging features extracted from resumes and job
descriptions.
3. Database Management: Use databases to store job seeker profiles,
resumes, job openings, and matching results securely. Consider using
relational databases or NoSQL databases depending on the scalability and
complexity of the system.
4. Web Development: Develop a user-friendly web application for job
seekers to create profiles, search for job openings, and receive
recommendations, as well as for employers/recruiters to post jobs, search
for candidates, and view resume matches.
